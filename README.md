# Smart Contract Tips

As part of STK's promise to the community of being transparent, we have started to do bi-weekly writeups of the latest research topics we are doing. Our team has decided to publish the bi-weekly articles onto GitHub, to allow the larger Ethereum Community to contribute. If you have an idea or a topic to add to our articles, we encourage PRs!
